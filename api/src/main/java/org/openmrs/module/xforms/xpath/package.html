Contains classes for xpath processing of forms before data entry.
Because the form designer widget stores language text as xpath expressions, when a user selects a form to
fill, the current locale is used to process the xpath expressions stored into the database to get the 
appropriate text for putting into the xform before sending it to the form entry widget.
These classes were originally copied from the purcforms widget but we could replace them with the 
appropriate standard xpath libraries available to java, whenever time will be available.
